# Monte Carlo Experiments for Time-lagged Spatial-lagged Regressions

Cody A. Drolc, Christopher Gandrud, and Laron K. Williams

## About 

This repository contains all of the source code to replicate the Monte Carlo simulations presented in "Taking Time (and Space) Seriously:
How Scholars Falsely Infer Policy Diffusion from Model Misspecification".

## Reproduction instructions

The simulations are run in R and coordinated with GNU make. To replicate the entire analysis, type into your terminal:

```bash
cd THE_DIRECTORY_WITH_THE_REPOSITORY

make clean
make
```
